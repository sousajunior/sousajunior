# Hi, welcome to my profile.

I'm **Carlinhos**, a young software developer and computer science bachelor from Brazil.

**I work as programmer since 2016** and during this time, i already have programmed with **C#, Ruby, Javascript and Python**.

Currently I'm working with my favourite language (**Ruby**), as a backend engineer at [@totalpass](https://totalpass.com/br/).

I have experience with some javascript frameworks like **Reactjs, Angular and Ionic**.

I like some designs frameworks too, like **Bootstrap, Materialize and Tailwind**.

In the database area, i worked with **postgres** on most part of time, but i already worked with **mongodb** as well.

I'm a developer that cannot work without tests, because **TDD is my religion**.

I consider myself a happy guy who is always trying to get people around him to have a good laugh.

I like **teamwork** and I'm always willing to help and learn from my fellow workers.

**My ideal work company** is composed of a relaxed work environment with people who like to help each other and share experiences.
