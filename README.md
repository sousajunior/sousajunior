# 👨🏻‍💻 Hi, welcome to my profile.

- I'm **Carlinhos**, a young software developer and computer science bachelor from Brazil 🇧🇷.

- **I work as programmer since 2016** and during this time, I already have programmed with **C#, Ruby, Javascript and Python**.

- Currently, I'm working with my favourite language (**Ruby** 💎), as a backend engineer at [@totalpass](https://totalpass.com/br/).

- I have experience with some javascript frameworks like **Reactjs, Angular and Ionic**.

- I've worked with some front-end frameworks too, like **Bootstrap ❤️, Materialize and Tailwind**.

- On the database area, I worked with **postgres** on most part of time, but I already worked with **mongodb** as well.

- I'm a developer that cannot work without tests because **TDD is my religion**.

- I consider myself a happy guy who is always trying to get people around him to have a good laugh.

- I like **teamwork** and I'm always willing to help and learn from my teammates.

- **My ideal work company** is composed of a relaxed work environment with people who like to help each other and share experiences.
